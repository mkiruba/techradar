### .NET Technologies

1. **Technology: ASP.NET Core**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: ASP.NET Core has seen a robust adoption rate in the industry, particularly among enterprises looking to build cross-platform applications. It is widely used in various sectors thanks to its performance and scalability.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the MIT License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Currently in the "Adopt" quadrant due to its widespread usage, active community, and continued support from Microsoft. Many enterprises are moving to embrace modern web development with this framework.
   - **Suggested Change**: Remain in the "Adopt" quadrant as it continues to evolve with new features and performance improvements.

2. **Technology: Entity Framework Core**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: Entity Framework Core has been increasingly adopted as the ORM of choice for .NET applications, especially for those who favor a code-first approach to data management.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the MIT License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Positioned in the "Adopt" quadrant because it provides a high level of productivity and integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core.
   - **Suggested Change**: Remain in the "Adopt" quadrant as its integration with .NET Core continues to enhance overall developer experience.

3. **Technology: .NET MAUI**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: Still in early adoption, with developers exploring its capabilities for cross-platform app development. Adoption is moderate but growing.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the MIT License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Positioned in the "Trial" quadrant due to its newness and the slow transition of developers from Xamarin to .NET MAUI. While promising, it hasn't fully proven itself in scalable applications yet.
   - **Suggested Change**: Consider moving to "Assess" as the developer community grows and feedback improves.

### Python Technologies

1. **Technology: Django**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: Django remains one of the most popular frameworks for building web applications in Python, with a strong industry presence across startups and enterprises alike.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the BSD License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Placed in the "Adopt" quadrant due to its proven robustness, community support, and the rich ecosystem of plugins.
   - **Suggested Change**: No change necessary, as Django remains a preferred choice among Python web frameworks.

2. **Technology: FastAPI**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: FastAPI has rapidly gained traction among developers, particularly for building APIs, thanks to its performance and ease of use.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the MIT License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Currently in the "Trial" quadrant; it is being embraced for new projects but lacks the extensive use cases compared to Django.
   - **Suggested Change**: Move to "Adopt" as its performance advantages become clear in production environments and backing from strong community support.

3. **Technology: Flask**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: Flask continues to hold a significant place in the Python ecosystem for lightweight applications, with a loyal user base.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the BSD License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Currently positioned in the "Adopt" quadrant as it strikes a balance between flexibility and simplicity, making it a favorite among developers for microservices.
   - **Suggested Change**: No changes recommended; Flask remains a dependable framework.

4. **Technology: Celery**
   - **Current Adoption Levels**: Celery is widely used for asynchronous task queues in Python applications but faces competition from modern solutions like RQ and other cloud services.
   - **Licensing**: Open-source (under the BSD License).
   - **Quadrant Insights**: Placed in the "Assess" quadrant because while it is powerful, new developers are advocating for simpler, more integrated solutions that improve ease of use.
   - **Suggested Change**: It may benefit from moving to the "Hold" quadrant, especially as new alternatives gain traction.
